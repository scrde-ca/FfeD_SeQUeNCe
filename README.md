## SeQUeNCe: Simulator of QUantum Network Communication

SeQUeNCe is an open source, discrete-event simulator for quantum networks. As described in our [paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12000), the simulator includes 5 modules on top of a simulation kernel:
* Hardware
* Entanglement Management
* Resource Management
* Network Management
* Application

These modules can be edited by users to define additional functionality and test protocol schemes, or may be used as-is to test network parameters and topologies.

## Installing
SeQUeNCe requires [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.9 or later. You can simply install SeQUeNCe using `pip`:
```
pip install sequence
```

If you wish to make your own edits to the codebase, SeQUeNCe should be installed in [development mode](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/development_mode.html) (a.k.a. editable install).
To do so, clone and install the simulator as follows:
```
git clone https://github.com/sequence-toolbox/SeQUeNCe.git
cd SeQUeNCe
make install_editable
```

If you do not have `make` command (i.e., Windows user), replace `make install_editable` with `pip install --editable . --config-settings editable_mode=strict`.

## Running the GUI
Once SeQUeNCe has been installed as described above, simply run the `gui.py` script found in the root of the project directory
```
$ python gui.py
```

## Usage Examples
Many examples of SeQUeNCe in action can be found in the [example](/example) folder. These include both quantum key distribution and entanglement distribution examples.

### Starlight Experiments
Code for the experiments performed in our paper can be found in the file `starlight_experiments.py`. This script uses the `starlight.json` file (also within the example folder) to specify the network topology.

### Jupyter Notebook Examples
The example folder contains several scripts that can be run with jupyter notebook for easy editing and visualization. These files require that the notebook package be installed (Anaconda recommended):
```
$ pip install notebook
$ pip install ipywidgets
```
To run each file, simply run
```
$ jupyter notebook <filename>
```
These examples include:
* `BB84_eg.ipynb`, which uses the BB84 protocol to distribute secure keys between two quantum nodes
* `two_node_eg.ipynb`, which performs entanglement generation between two adjacent quantum routers
* `three_node_eg_ep_es.ipynb`, which performs entanglement generation, purification, and swapping for a linear network of three quantum routers

## Integration with The-FfeD- Repository
This repository has been integrated with the [The-FfeD-](https://github.com/Celebrum/The-FfeD-.git) repository to enhance its functionality. The combined functionality allows users to leverage the features of both repositories seamlessly.

### Instructions for Using Combined Functionality
1. Clone the integrated repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/scrde-ca/FfeD_SeQUeNCe.git
   cd FfeD_SeQUeNCe
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the combined functionality tests to ensure everything is set up correctly:
   ```
   make test_combined
   ```

4. Refer to the documentation in both repositories for detailed usage instructions and examples.

## Additional Tools

### Network Visualization
The example directory contains an example json file `starlight.json` to specify a network topology, and the utils directory contains the script `draw_topo.py` to visualize json files. To use this script, the Graphviz library must be installed. Installation information can be found on the [Graphviz website](https://www.graphviz.org/download/).

To view a network, simply run the script and specify the relative location of your json file:
```
$ python utils/draw_topo.py example/starlight.json
```
This script also supports a flag `-m` to visualize BSM nodes created by default on quantum links between routers.

## Libraries Used
This project includes a modified fork of the Quantum++ library version 2.6.
Please see the Quantum++ [`LICENSE`](https://github.com/softwareQinc/qpp/blob/main/LICENSE) file for more information.
